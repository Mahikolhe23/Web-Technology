            A volcano is a rupture in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)"
                style="font-size: 20;">crust</a> of a
            planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava,
            volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.On <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" style="font-size: 20;">Earth</a>
            volcanoes are most often
            found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging, and most are found underwater.

            For example, a mid-ocean
            ridge, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by divergent <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tectonic_plates" style="font-size: 20;">tectonic plates</a>
            whereas the Pacific
            Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates. Volcanoes can also form where there is
            stretching
            and thinning of the crust's plates, such as in the East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic
            field
            and Rio Grande rift in North America. Volcanism away from plate boundaries has been postulated to arise from
            upwelling diapirs from the core–mantle boundary, 3,000 kilometers (1,900 mi) deep in the Earth. This results
            in
            hotspot
            volcanism, of which the Hawaiian hotspot is an example. Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic
            plates slide past one another. Large eruptions can affect atmospheric temperature as ash and droplets of
            sulfuric acid obscure the Sun and cool
            the Earth's troposphere. Historically, large volcanic eruptions have been followed by volcanic winters which
            havecaused catastrophic famines.[1]

        <p>The most common perception of a volcano is of a conical mountain, spewing lava and poisonous gases from a
            crater at its summit; however, this describes just one of the many types of volcano. The features of
            volcanoes are much more complicated and their structure and behavior depends on a number of factors.
            Some volcanoes have rugged peaks formed by lava domes rather than a summit crater while others have
            landscape features such as massive plateaus. Vents that issue volcanic material (including lava and ash)
            and gases (mainly steam and magmatic gases) can develop anywhere on the landform and may give rise to
            smaller cones such as Puʻu ʻŌʻō on a flank of Kīlauea in Hawaii.
        </p>
        <p>Other types of volcano include
            cryovolcanoes (or ice volcanoes), particularly on some moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune; and mud
            volcanoes, which are formations often not associated with known magmatic activity. Active mud volcanoes tend
            to
            involve temperatures much lower than those of igneous volcanoes except when the mud volcano is
            actually a vent of an igneous volcano.
